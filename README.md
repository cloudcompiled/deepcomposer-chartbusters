# deepcomposer-chartbusters
Custom AR-CNN model for AWS Deepcomposer Chartbusters. The model was trained using Calypso and Caribbean folk music.

**Repository contains:** 
- Jupyter Notebook
- Checkpoints (due to file size limits only the ones that was used for the outputs I chose are included )
- Outputs: selection of music pieces generated by the model


Process: 
1. Trained a custom AR-CNN model
2. Created melody with Deepcomposer 
3. Uploaded melody to sagemaker and used custom model to generate new piece
4. Downloaded output and uploaded it back to deepcomposer and used MuseGAN to apply additional accompaniment.

## Generated Pieces & Corresponding checkpoints 
**Little Banjo** (output_8.mid): AR-CNN custom model +  MuseGAN Rock (accompaniment) 
This piece was inspired by a popular St. Lucian folk song and was generated using checkpoint -best-model-epoch/0031.hdf5

**Home sweet Home** (output_11.mid): AR-CNN  + drums & trumpet added in post prod
This piece was generated using checkpoint -best-model-epoch/0038.hdf5 and is an attempt at the style of Calypso, a genre of music originating in the Caribbean.
